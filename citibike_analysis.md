# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
In this challenge, I analyzed population of cities in relation to how many people used Citi bikes.
## Population of Des Moines
The population of Des Moines has been in the 200,000s for the past 10 or so years.
### Population of New York
The population of New York City has been approximately 8 million people for the past 10 or so years.
#### Population in relation to people using bike-sharing program
In my analysis, I counted the amount of subscribers/users in New York City in relation to its population--which was ~65,000/8 mil. Des Moines is a much smaller city population-wise than New York and is more spread out and less dense, meaning that inhabitants will likely use cars rather than individual transportation, like biking. If we were to take the numbers of New York, less than 1% of the Des Moines population would use Citi bikes. I do not think that Citi bikes would be a good investment in the city of Des Moines.
